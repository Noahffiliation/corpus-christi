# Testing

This document details our testing standards.

## API Testing

API testing uses these packages:
- [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/index.html) - test framework
- [`pytest-cov`](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - coverage testing

### Overview

Each component of the API has its own dedicated test file(s).
Here is an example from `i18n`.
```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize('id, desc', locale_tuples)
def test_delete_one_locale(client, dbs, id, desc):
    # GIVEN locales from static data
    create_locales(dbs)

    # WHEN one locale deleted
    resp = client.delete(url_for('i18n.delete_one_locale', locale_id=id))

    # THEN result is "No content"
    assert resp.status_code == 204

    # AND the deleted locale doesn't exist in the database.
    result = I18NLocale().query.all()
    assert len(result) == len(locale_tuples) - 1
    for loc in result:
        assert loc.id != id
        assert loc.desc != desc
```
Things to note as patterns for new tests:
- Name the test "`test_` _something-close-to-name-of-endpoint_"
- Parmetrize tests as approrpriate to broaden test coverage
- Use the [`GIVEN-WHEN-THEN`](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/GivenWhenThen.html)
  framework for documenting tests.
- Always test status codes and returned content
- Do as many `assert` calls as necessary to check all possible outcomes.
- Use the ORM to set up or verify the contents of the database as required.
- Don't hardwire URLs into tests;
  use the `url_for` function,
  which takes the name of the **view function**
  that implements the endpoint under test.

### Fixtures

The `pytest` package uses _fixtures_ to share common
data among tests.
Most fixtures are defined in the `conftest.py` file
and include:
1. `app` is the top-level Flask application object
1. `client` is the Flask test client;
   this is the object to use to make requests to the API. 
1. `orm` is the object-relational mapper (SQLAlchemy)
1. `dbs` is a database "session" object for SQL alchemy;
   use this to execute database operations
   via SQLAlchemy models.
To access a fixture from within a test,
simply name it in the test function's argument list.
The `pytest` framework will inject the fixture,
making it available to your test.

### Status Codes

The API should use these status codes; **check** for them.

- `200` - `Ok`: everything worked and there is no more specific status code
- `201` - `Created`: a new resources was _created_ successfully.
- `204` - `No content`: confirm that a resource has been _deleted_
- `400` - `Bad request`: something was wrong with the request,
  and we couldn't give back more information;
  the error status of last resort
- `404` - `Not found`: the resource couldn't be located
- `422` - `Unprocessable entity`: the request failed validation
- `500` - `Internal server error`: something on the server went horribly wrong.
  In general, API code should _not_ return this;
  it normally comes from the system or framework.
  
### Running Tests

To run tests from bash: 
```bash
pytest
```
This will run all the test files in and under
the current directory.
To specific a specific directory use:
```bash
pytest <dirname>
```
To run just the tests in a specific file:
```bash
pytest <test-file>.py
```
To run just one test function:
```bash
pytest <test-file>.py::<function-name>
```

### Coverage Testing

We are aiming for 100% test coverage.
To generate a coverage report while testing:
```bash
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
```
The `--cov` flag tells `pytest`
to look for tests _only_ within the given directory.
Without this flag, `pytest` may recurse into
unintended source directories (e.g., your virtual environment),
which will take a _Long Time_ to complete.

The `--cov-report` flag tells `pytest` to generate
a report in one of various formats.
Specifying `html` creates a nice report in 
a directory called `htmlcov`.
Open `htmlcov/index.html` to view the results.

If you don't specify a report format,
`pytest` outputs a nice text table to your terminal
after the tests complete.

These coverage flags can be used with any of the variants
mentioned under _Running Tests_.

## UI Testing

UI testing uses this package:
- [`Cypress`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html#In-a-nutshell)

### Overview

Each module in the UI has its own folder and test files for various functions.
Here is an example from `events`.
```javascript
describe("Update Event Test", function() {
  before(() => {
    cy.login();
  });

  it("GIVEN: Event Planner goes to Event page", function() {
    cy.visit("/events/all");
  });

  it("WHEN: Event Planner wants to update an event", function() {
    // Put a new title on the event
    cy.get("[data-cy=edit]")
      .eq(0)
      .click();
    cy.get("[data-cy=title]").type(" V2");

    // Rewrite a new description of the event
    cy.get("[data-cy=description]").clear();
    cy.get("[data-cy=description]").type("A whole new description.");

    cy.get("[data-cy=form-save]").click();
  });

  it("THEN: Event title should be updated", function() {
    // Switch to see all events on one page
    cy.get(
      ".v-datatable__actions__select > .v-input > .v-input__control > .v-input__slot > .v-select__slot"
    ).click();
    cy.contains("Todos").click();

    // Check for new title in tablekdescribe("Update Event Test", function() {
  before(() => {
    cy.login();
  });

  it("GIVEN: Event Planner goes to Event page", function() {
    cy.visit("/events/all");
  });

  it("WHEN: Event Planner wants to update an event", function() {
    // Put a new title on the event
    cy.get("[data-cy=edit]")
      .eq(0)
      .click();
    cy.get("[data-cy=title]").type(" V2");

    // Rewrite a new description of the event
    cy.get("[data-cy=description]").clear();
    cy.get("[data-cy=description]").type("A whole new description.");

    cy.get("[data-cy=form-save]").click();
  });

  it("THEN: Event title should be updated", function() {
    // Switch to see all events on one page
    cy.get(
      ".v-datatable__actions__select > .v-input > .v-input__control > .v-input__slot > .v-select__slot"
    ).click();
    cy.contains("Todos").click();

    // Check for new title in table
    cy.get(":nth-child(1) > :nth-child(1)").contains(" V2");
  });

  it("AND: The event description should be updated", function() {
    cy.get("[data-cy=edit]")
      .eq(0)
      .click();

    cy.get("[data-cy=description]").should(
      "have.value",
      "A whole new description."
    );
  });
});
    cy.get(":nth-child(1) > :nth-child(1)").contains(" V2");
  });

  it("AND: The event description should be updated", function() {
    cy.get("[data-cy=edit]")
      .eq(0)
      .click();

    cy.get("[data-cy=description]").should(
      "have.value",
      "A whole new description."
    );
  });
```
Things to note as patterns for new tests:
- Name the test "_something-related-to-test_`_spec.js`"
- Use the [`GIVEN-WHEN-THEN`](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/GivenWhenThen.html)
  framework for documenting tests.

### Setup Testing Data
```
Note: The Cypress tests could fail for multiple reasons. Any slight changes
to the UI side or the server side could cause a test fail.  One of the standard
solutions is to write/update an inspection as soon as the developer finished one sec
-tion. 

CC requires login credentials, and the application has the features to represent the
church hierarchy. The test should be designed base on different roles.

```
 1. Creat an account with a role:  
    Under the **corpus-christi/api**, render the virtual environment & create an account with following command:  
    ```
    source ./bin/set-up-bash.sh
    flask people new --roles role.group-admin Cytest password
    ```
    The second line of command creates an account with **Username:** Cytest and **Password:** password in the data base.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
    Note: There are multiple roles can be assigned to an account. **role.group-admin** can   
    be replaced following roles:  
    * role.infrastructure
    * role.superuser
    * role.group-admin
    * role.group-leader
    * role.group-overseer
    * role.registrar
    * role.teaching-assistant
    * role.event-planner
    * role.visitor
  2. Generate random data:  
  There are 2 ways to generate testing data: **command** and **manually input from front-end**  
  - [`Common commands for faking testing data`](https://github.com/corpus-christi/corpus-christi/blob/development/doc/cli.md)
                                                                                                                            

### Running Tests

To run tests from bash (from the `ui` folder):
```bash
yarn run cypress run
```
This will run all the test files in the `ui` folder.
To specify a specific directory use:
```bash
yarn run cypress run --spec 'path/to/<dirname>/*'
```
To run just the tests in a specific file:
```bash
yarn run cypress run --spec 'path/to/<test-file>.js'
```
To run multiple test files/directories:
```bash
yarn run cypress run --spec 'path/to/<test-file>.js,path/to/<other-test-file>.js'
```
**NOTE**: When these tests are run from the command line, they record video of all tests and take screenshots of failed tests, stored in `ui/tests/e2e/screenshots` and `ui/tests/e2e/videos`

### Opening Cypress
To run the tests from the Cypress Test Runner use:
```bash
yarn run cypress open
```
From there you can run the tests in an open browser.

For more information on the Test Runner, see the [`Cypress docs`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/test-runner.html#Overview)

Also check out the [`Best Practices`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html) section of the Cypress docs for the best way to select elements and organize tests.

### Notes

For Windows users, the Cypress Test Runner may not open from the command line.

In that case, you will need to get Cypress from their [`direct download`](http://download.cypress.io/desktop) and point it at the `ui` folder.

Also, running Cypress from the command line may require extra dependencies, so run this command to install them:
```bash
sudo apt-get install xvfb libgtk2.0-0 libnotify-dev libgconf-2-4 libnss3 libxss1 libasound2
```
