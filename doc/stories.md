# Terms

1. By **application** we mean the entire _Corpus Christi_ (CC) system, including
  the user interface, API, database, administrative tools, etc.
1. CC implements a design pattern commonly called a _Single Page Application_
  (or _SPA_). To avoid terminological confusion with the previous definition of
  _application_, we refer to the SPA portion of CC as either the **user
  interface** (commonly, the **UI**) or the **web app**.
1. CC consists of several cooperating subsystems,
   each of which addresses
   a single coherent aspect of church management.
   We refer to these subsystems as **modules**.
   Initially, CC contains the following modules:

    1. `groups` - Home church/small group management and tracking
    1. `courses` - Teaching ministry management
    1. `events` - Event planning and registration

   A _module_ is intended to encompass standalone functionality
   that can optionally be used by a particular church
   in combination with any other module(s).
1. Underlying and supporting the _modules_,
   CC includes functionality we call **infrastructure**,
   which includes:
   
   1. Administrative functions (e.g., account creation)
   1. Authentication (using JSON Web Tokens)
   1. Role-based authorization 
   1. Internationalization (I18N) and Localization (L10N) 

1. Although we use the term **user** informally throughout,
   CC's data model does _not_ include a user entity.
   Instead:

   1. Any individual (human) tracked by the system we call a **Person**.
      The database includes a `Person` table.

   1. A _Person_ may be associated with an _Account_,
      which grants that _Person_ login access to CC.

   Consequently, the combination of a _Person_ and an _Account_
   can informally be considered a "user." 

# Roles

This section details the roles implemented in CC.

## Visitor

Portions of CC are available to completely unauthenticated users.
Strictly speaking, such a user does not have a role.
However, for convenience, we consider such users to have a **visitor** "role"
that permits them access to _only_ the public content of the application.

A **visitor** cannot enroll in courses, sign up for events, etc.
without first registering with CC and thereby becoming a **public user**.

_Example_: someone browsing a list of upcoming events 
or viewing the home church map to identify a home church.

## Public

A **visitor** can register for an account on the system,
promoting the visitor to a **public** user.
When registering as a **public** user,
a church attendee submits personal data just once,
simplifying course registration and event sign up in the future.
Registration creates a _Person_ instance for the user.

During registration, a **public** user provides a username and password
that are stored in the _Person_ entity and are used later
when the user wants to interact with the system.

For example, 
if a public user clicks through a link to register for an _Event_,
he or she is prompted to enter their username and password,
which is used to look up their _Person_ data and 
complete the registration or sign-up.

It is also possible for a **visitor** to click on a link
for an _Event_ or _Course_.
Consequently, the page that requests username and password
should also include a link to the page where a visitor
can sign up to become a **public** user.

### Public User Validation

Data entered during **public** user registration
is considered **unconfirmed**
and must be validated by an authorized CC account holder.
The goal of this process is to vet data entering the system, 
eliminate duplicate data, and generally avoid unquality.

For example:
1. A **visitor** registers to become a **public** user.
1. CC creates an unconfirmed _Person_ and associated _Account_ instance.
1. A CC user with the **infrastructure** role inspects the unconfirmed _Person_ instance.
   The user may:
   1. Reject the _Person_ instance, deleting it and the associated _Account_ from the database.
      For example, an empty, incomplete, or obviously bogus entry can simply be removed
      (actually _deleted_, not just marked inactive).
   1. Search for an existing _Person_ instance that matches this public user
      (e.g., from a previous registration).
      CC provides tools to identify an existing _Person_ instance (e.g., live search).
      - If _no_ existing _Person_ is found,
        and the data submitted by the would-be **public** user is valid, 
        the **infrastructure** user
        marks the _Person_ record as `confirmed`.
      - If an existing _Person_ _is_ found, the **infrastructure** user
        reconciles the existing and new _Person_ instances into a single _Person_
        instance (e.g., updating the older _Person_ with new data)
        and marks the resulting _Person_ record as confirmed.
        It should be easy for the **infrastructure** user to 
        to see both the existing and new _Person_ details
        and to choose the version that will "survive"
        into the single, final _Person_ record.

### Self Registration

A **public** user may self register for:
- A _Course Offering_
- An _Event_

The **public** user clicks on the offering or event
then supplies his or her username and password.
The system validates these login credentials
and, if valid, adds the corresponding _Person_
to the _Event_, _Course Offering_, etc.



## Infrastructure

1. An **infrastructure** user is someone who can access and update
   the CC infrastructure data, including people and places.
   
   _Example_: church office worker adding a new _Account_ to the system
   or authorizing an existing account as having a particular _Role_.

1. A **superuser** is a user with essentially unlimited access to CC.
   Following are examples of things a **superuser** can do:
   - Use _all_ UI views
   - Access _all_ API endpoints
   - Modify data that is tied to application code (e.g., _Role_ data)
   - Update the CC software itself (e.g., patch defects, upgrade to new releases)
   
1. A **translator** is a user who can create or update localization
   (translation) data.
   
   _Example_: a user wants to localize CC into a previously unsupported 
   natural language. 

## Groups Module

1. A **group admin** is user who manages the Groups module.

   _Example_: user who wants to create a new group,
   or assign a new leader to an existing group,
   or add a _Person_ to an existing group,
   or split a large group into two new, smaller groups.

1. A **group leader** is in charge of a single group.

   _Example_: send a message to group members,
   or indicate that a member has attended a group meeting.

1. A **group overseer** is responsible for multiple groups.

   _Example_: send a message to members of all groups
   that the user oversees, or send a message to just the
   leaders those groups
   
## Courses Module

1. A **registrar** is a user who manages the data in the `courses` module.

   _Example_: Christian education pastor who wants to create a new course
   or grant a diploma.
   
1. A **teaching assistant** is a user who can manage course and class data
   related to _conducting classes_ (as opposed to _creating courses_,
   which is done by the **registrar**).
   
   _Example_: enter class attendance, update class meeting times,
   assign a substitute teacher for a single class.

## Events Module

1. An **event planner** is a user who manages data in the `events` module.

   _Example_: An office worker wants to create add details for an upcoming
   retreat or schedule a worship band for the next Sunday worship service. 

# CRUD Pattern

Many stories apply one or more of the 
standard **CRUD** operations 
(_Create_, _Read_, _Update_, _Delete_)
to an entity. For example:

1. Create a new course.
1. Read the details of an existing course.
1. Update an existing course.
1. Delete an existing course.

In some cases, we don't _delete_ data,
which can lose useful historical information.
Instead, some entities have an `active` attribute
that can be set to `false` to
_deactivate_ it.
SQL DDL that operates on such entities
must take the `active` attribute into account.
For example, when listing members of a group,
a query should return only members
whose `active` attribute is `true`.

# User Stories

Following are user stories for each of the roles
enumerated above.

## Visitor

1. A **visitor** should be able to create an _Account_ and the associated _Person_,
   "promoting" the **visitor** to a **public** user.
   This will allow a church attendee to enter personal data just once
   and reuse it in the future without reentering it.

   When a **visitor* creates an account,
   be generous with the the `username`.
   There must be one, but it:
   - must be unique across all _Account_'s
   - can be an email address
   - can be a phone number
   - can be a tax ID number (common identifier in Ecuador)
   - can be an arbitrary string (user may not have an email address or username)
   
   Require a password with a minimum length of 8 characters
   with at least one letter and one number.

## Public

1. Update existing _Person_ or _Account_ data.

1. Authenticate with an existing _Account_
   by providing a valid username and password
   (e.g., when signing up for an _Event_). 
   Follow this procedure:
   1. If there is an _Account_ with the username,
      try to validate with the _Account_ and its hashed_password.
   1. If that fails,
      search for a _Person_ with a phone number matching what the user entered as a username;
      if such a _Person_ record exists and has an associated _Account_,
      try validating with the phone number as the username and the hashed password
      of the associated _Account_
   1. If that fails,
      search for a _Person_ with an email address matching what the user entered as a username;
      if such a _Person_ record exists and has an associated _Account_,
      try validating with the email address as the username and the hashed password
      of the associated _Account_
   1. If that fails,
      offer the user the option of
      - entering an email address to receive a password reset link
      - creating a new _Account_ and _Person_ (as above)
      If the email address doesn't exist in the _Person_ entity,
      inform the user of that fact and allow them to enter a different one.
      If the email address does exist,
      indicate that the user should check for a new email to that address.
      
      The email sent to a known email address should include a password reset link.
      The link should contain:
      - A URL for the CC password reset page
      - A freshly generated token (e.g., a SHA1 hash of the current date/time)
        that is stored in the _Account_ table with the email address.

      In addition, an expiration timestamp should be stored in the _Account_ entity,
      set for four hours in the future.

1. Handle a password reset email.
   Upon clicking the link:
   - If the link contains a valid, unexpired password reset token, the user should
     be directed to a page on which the password for the account matching
     the token may be changed (enter password, repeat)
   - If the link contains a nonexistent password reset token, the user should
     be directed to a page indicating that the link is invalid.
   - If the link contains a valid password token with an expired timestamp,
     the user should be informed that they waited to long to reset the password
     and be given the opportunity to start over by submitting their email address.
   If a token is found (whether expired or not),
   it and the associated expiration timestamp should be deleted from the
   the _Account_ entity.
